Name: 3-D Transitions

Description: Supports line drawing onto a 3 Dimensional Space and translated into a 2 Dimensional Plane. 

The program currently supports Translating, Scaling and Rotating. There are extended transitions such as,
'Scale At' and 'Rotate at' which will translate at a certain point. 

There are 6 input boxes on the top right. Each button uses these input boxes differenty. For certain commands
some boxes are not nessary. 
	Draw Line - [x0] [x1] [y0] [y1] [z0] [z1]
	Translate - [tx] [ty] [tz]
	Scale - [Sx] [Sy] [Sz]
	Scale At - [Sx] [Sy] [Sz] [cx] [cy] [cz]
	Rotate - [degrees]
	Rotate At- Not Supported
After you implemented your transitions you will need to click 'Apply Trans.' to concatenate the matrices and update the transitions that have been made.
