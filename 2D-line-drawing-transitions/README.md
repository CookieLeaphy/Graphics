Graphics CSCI 4810

The purpose of this program is to create lines on a 2-D plane and to apply transition matrices.

The program currently supports Translating, Scaling and Rotating. There are extended transitions such as,
'Scale At' and 'Rotate at' which will translate at a certain point. 

There are 4 input boxes on the top right. Each button uses these input boxes differenty. For certain commands
some boxes are not nessary. 
	Draw Line - [x0] [x1] [y0] [y1]
	Translate - [tx] [ty]
	Scale - [Sx] [Sy]
	Scale At - [Sx] [Sy] [cx] [cy]
	Rotate - [degrees]
	Rotate At - [degrees] [Cx] [Cy]

After you implemented your transitions you will need to click 'Apply Trans.' to concatenate the matrices and update the transitions that have been made.
